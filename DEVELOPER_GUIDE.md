## Running locally

### Node

We depend upon the version of node defined in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc).

You will probably want to install a node version manager. [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended.

To install and use the correct node version v with `nvm`:

v - version mentioned in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc).

```
nvm install
```

And then also set the node version to use in your terminal

```
nvm use
```

Confirm the version of node by running:
```
yarn node --version
```

### Start documentation server

You can run the documentation locally at [http://localhost:8030/](http://localhost:8030/) by running the following.

```
yarn
yarn start
```

If another process is already listening on port 8030, the next free port will be used. Alternatively, you can specify a port:

```
yarn start --port 9000
```
